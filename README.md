# Prioritizing Articles Based On Topic - Array vs. Priority Queue

In this project, I program an algorithm and compare the performance of two data structures throughout the process

Algorithm:
Takes in article name and a topic, assign a priority value to the article, and sort using insert sort.

Data Structures:
- Java Array
- Priority queue of nodes that prioritizes using insert sort

In the pdf file, you will find my essay where I explain my program for the general audience, starting from explaining data structures, and go on to walk through my algorithm as well as rate the data structure performance in terms of time complexity.
